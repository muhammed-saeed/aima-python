The **performance element** is responsible for selecting external actions for the agent: it takes in percepts and decides on actions. The critic tells the learning element how well the agent is doing with respect to a fixed performance standard. It is necesaary because the percepts themselves provide no indication of the agent's success. The last component of the learning agent is the **problem generator**.
